# Linear optimization in Python

Slides and code for my Python Edinburgh talk on linear programming, 26th May 2015.

The current version of the slides can be seen at http://rawgit.com/pozorvlak/linprog_talk/master/index.html.

To build the slides or run the sample code, you'll first have to install the dependencies (probably in a virtualenv):

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then you can build the slides by running

    slidedeck render

or run the sample code using `./scriptname.py` as usual. The script `election/election.py` expects to be run from the `election` subdirectory.
